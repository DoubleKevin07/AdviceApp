# AdviceApp
A little JavaScript/html/css demo.

## What does it do?
You enter text in a box, and get positive feedback.

## What's so special about it?
The text box fades in when you open the page, the colors have OK contrast, and in general is meant to "feel smooth."

## How do I use it?
Check out a quick preview here:

However, it will most likely not work when you press "Get Advice."

To get a full preview, download the source code and open "index.html" =)
